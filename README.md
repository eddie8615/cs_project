### Project Structure
This project contains the entire contents of my project. 
The `demonstration.ipynb` file is the file that I put all of my tasks and the contents are listed in order.

There are few directories in this project structure
* dataset: This directory has only KOSPI csv file obtained from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EKS11?p=^KS11&.tsrc=fin-srch)
* images: This directory has figures of the forecast results of all proposed models

To run `demonstration.ipynb`, you need to install all python packages listed in `requirement.txt`

* Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv (venv name)`
* Activate the environment
    * Linux/Mac: source `source (venv name)/bin/activate`
    * Windows: `(venv name)\Scripts\activate.bat`
    
* To install the pacakges, run `pip3 install -r requirement.txt` in the terminal.
